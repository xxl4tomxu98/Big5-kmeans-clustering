### Cluster-personality-kmeans (Kaggle dataset: IPIP-FFM-data-8Nov2018)

#### Dataset with no label so we cluster it using kmeans to generate 10(arbitary) personality catagories

#### The clustered catagory numbers are normalized and bar charts created in jupyter notebook

#### data is based 2018 update version with metadata which can be used for further ML study

#### Introduction
    The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.

### The Dataset
    This dataset contains 1,015,342 questionnaire answers collected online by Open Psychometrics.
